0.02 - Initialisation

    Changes since previous version:
    
        * the term "piece" has been changed to "pawn" as piece is ambiguous (may be confused with a "wall")
        * the "Move" interface for generic moves has been renamed to "GenericMove" so its meaning is more clear
        * removed the "Gap" class. A hash set could also be used to constantly check if a wall is placed and seems more elegant.

    Eclipse project has been started.
